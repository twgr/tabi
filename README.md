# TABI: Target-Aware Bayesian Inference

This repo accompanies the code for the paper:

"Target–Aware Bayesian Inference: How to Beat the Theoretically Optimal Self–Normalized Monte Carlo Estimator"

by Tom Rainforth, Adam Golinski, Frank Wood, and Sheheryar Zaidi.

We are currently working on cleaning the code base ready for public release and expect it to be published here shortly.
